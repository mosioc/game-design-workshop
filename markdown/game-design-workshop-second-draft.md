## **GAME DESIGN FUNDAMENTALS: A Critical Workshop for Practitioners**

- - -

### **PART 1: Deconstructing the Designer's Role (20 min)**

**Beyond the Romanticized Vision**

* The reality: designers are **problem-solvers, not visionaries**
* The fragmentation of design roles (gameplay, systems, level, economy, narrative, UX, technical)
* Case study: RDR2's horse designer—hyperspecialization as both blessing and constraint
* **The uncomfortable truth**: Most designers are iterating in gray box, not creating masterpieces
* Design as documentation: how designers spend more time writing than "designing"
* The collaborative nightmare: when artists, programmers, and executives override your vision
* **Critical lens**: How AAA production pipelines constrain creative agency

### **PART 2: The MDA Framework as Critical Tool (30 min)**

**Mechanics → Dynamics → Aesthetics: Reverse-Engineering Player Manipulation**

**Understanding the Framework:**

* Mechanics exist in code, dynamics in player actions, aesthetics in player feelings—designers can only directly control mechanics, but changes cascade down to alter dynamics and aesthetics
* Why this matters: You're not designing games, you're **engineering emotional responses**

**Deep Analysis Exercise:**

* **Alien Isolation's evolution**:

  * Automatic checkpoints (borrowed from Call of Duty/BioShock) = players walked without fear
  * Manual save stations that take time = players became afraid of dying and losing progress; saving itself became tense
  * **The lesson**: Context destroys universality—what works in action games kills horror games

* **Zelda: Breath of the Wild's breaking weapons**:

  * Mechanic: Weapons degrade and break
  * Dynamics: Players hoard less, experiment more, engage with world's resources
  * Aesthetics: Feeling of exploration in a decaying world
  * **Counter-argument**: Does this annoy hardcore players? Is frustration always bad design?

**The Critical Question:** Are you borrowing mechanics because they work in other games, or because they serve YOUR specific vision?

### **PART 3: Vision-Driven Design vs. Design-by-Committee (25 min)**

**The Ideology Behind Every Mechanic**

**Defining Vision (Not Vague "Fun"):**

* Vision as **emotional contract**: What specific feeling are you promising?

* Examples:

  * Subnautica: "Thrill of the unknown"
  * Resident Evil Village: "Struggle to survive"
  * Doom 2016: "Push forward combat"

**Case Study: Flower's Radical Subtractions**

* Originally had level-ups, spells, resource management, time limits—"expected features of other video games"—all removed because they contradicted the intended emotions of relaxation and calm
* Genova Chen: "We've played so many games growing up, these bad habits form"
* **The radical act**: Removing what "every game has"

**When Everything Aligns:**

* Doom 2016: Movement speed, glory kills for health, enemies that flee, heavy metal soundtrack, violent animations—everything supports "push forward combat"
* Genova Chen: "All the elements have to sing the same notes to make the impact strong"

**The Uncomfortable Reality:**

* Most games suffer from **coherence failure**—mechanics fighting each other
* Example: Callisto Protocol has limited ammo (fear) but one-button instant stealth kills (power)—which emotion wins?

### **PART 4: The Political Economy of Borrowing Mechanics (30 min)**

**Why the Industry Copies Itself to Death**

**Section A: The Borrowing Imperative (10 min)**

* Game design exists in **intertextual space**—no mechanic is truly original
* The economic pressure: Publishers fund what's proven
* Far Cry 2 vs. Far Cry 4: Same franchise, same setting, but FC2's weapon jamming/malaria/permadeath = harrowing struggle; FC4's abundance = power fantasy
* **Critical insight**: Your game's "feel" comes from mechanical choices, not narrative window-dressing

**The Right Way to Steal:**

1. Analyze through MDA: What does this mechanic make players DO? How does it make them FEEL?
2. Ask: Does that feeling serve MY vision?
3. Adapt ruthlessly—don't just import

**Section B: When Copying Becomes Derivative (10 min)**

**The Soulslike Problem:**

* Early wave just copied bonfires, Estus flasks, souls mechanics
* Treated genre as checklist, not philosophy
* If you consider a genre "a long list of must-have mechanics," you'll "end up making the same thing over and over again"

**Dead Space's Sonic Identity Crisis:**

* EA initially requested "predictable sci-fi soundtrack"—electronics and drums
* Made players feel heroic, not scared
* Composer had to fight to align music with horror vision
* **Lesson**: Gary Napper: "Like any development team we all play a lot of games... often our decisions and choices are colored by the games we play" but those choices must fit your specific game

**Section C: Mechanical Contradictions (10 min)**

**When Borrowed Mechanics Fight:**

* Alien Isolation's degenerate strategy: Rush checkpoint, die, respawn safe
* Borrowed "convenient" mechanic undermined "scary" mechanic
* Solution: Manual save stations that take time and risk—"saving became tense, looking for a save became tense"

**The Flower Philosophy Revisited:**

* Sometimes "fun doesn't always help the emotion you want to deliver"
* Courage to remove what "should" be there

### **PART 5: The Playtesting Industrial Complex (20 min)**

**Why Your Ideas Are Probably Bad (And That's OK)**

**The Foundational Problem:**

* Your brain is a "truly bad video game simulator"—everything seems fun in your mind's eye
* You can only spot problems, design flaws, and unintended issues when the game is real
* A game idea is "worthless until you've proven its value through a prototype"

**What Playtesting Actually Reveals:**

* Players misunderstand "obvious" mechanics
* Players find exploits you never imagined
* Players do the exact opposite of what you intended
* Sometimes it's emergent fun (Rocket League's flying cars); sometimes it's degenerate strategies that "undermine your emotional goals"

**The Target Audience Problem:**

* Spider-Man's "disappointing" web-swinging: critic wanted complexity and challenge, but blockbuster PS4 game was made for casual gamers who got an "incredible sensation of being Spider-Man"
* A game is built for a "target audience, a specific type of person or player"—you can't please everyone

**The Accessibility Question:**

* Celeste's assist mode: explains how the game is "supposed to be played" but offers difficulty reduction if needed
* Options don't threaten vision if you communicate the intended experience

### **PART 6: Breaking Into the Industry's Broken Systems (15 min)**

**The Realpolitik of Game Design Careers**

**What Actually Matters:**

1. **Portfolio over credentials**: Make stuff—show your ability to design; put projects in a portfolio
2. **Design thinking**: Can you analyze mechanics critically?
3. **Soft skills**: Collaboration, handling criticism, pitching ideas
4. **Experience** (even tangential)

**Portfolio Reality Check:**

* Small projects, vertical slices, game jam prototypes—"don't need to be full games"
* Must have "clear documentation for how you dreamt up, designed, implemented, and refined your ideas"
* Focus on "best work" and "quality over quantity"

**Alternative Paths:**

* Start in QA/testing—"not uncommon for qa testers... to impress their bosses and get moved into design roles"
* But remember: "qa is a vitally important role in of itself and shouldn't be seen as just a stepping stone"
* Your first job "probably won't be designing games at blizzard or bungie"—get experience at smaller studios first

**University: Worth It?**

* Almost everyone warned: "the college diploma itself isn't the important bit... it's about making the most of the opportunities and connections"
* A game design degree is "not a guarantee of a good job" and "not a requirement"

**Interview Warfare:**

* They'll ask: "what would happen if you remove one of the options in rock paper scissors?"—testing your understanding of game balance
* They'll dismantle your portfolio pieces "to see how you'll react to criticism"

**Industry's Dark Side:**

* Crunch, layoffs, harassment exist
* But "while these problems exist they should not discourage you from joining the business and... strides are being made to improve these practices"

### **PART 7: Meta-Lessons for Critics-as-Designers (10 min)**

**What 10 Years of Analysis Teaches**

1. **Mechanics create experience, not narrative** (Far Cry lesson)
2. **"It depends"** is the only honest answer to most design questions
3. **Design for your audience**, not for yourself (Spider-Man humility)
4. **Borrowing requires understanding** the emotional purpose
5. **Genres are suggestions**, not laws
6. **Your brain lies to you**—prototype everything
7. **Players are unpredictable**—test constantly
8. The biggest lesson: "any lesson you've learned needs to be constantly re-evaluated"—never take design wisdom "as gospel, especially if it's coming from a YouTuber"

**For Critics Specifically:**

* Analysis ≠ Design, but critical thinking is 50% of the job
* Your ability to deconstruct games is your **competitive advantage**
* Use your analytical skills to reverse-engineer successful mechanics
* But remember: understanding why something works doesn't mean you can execute it
